Soseki replaces spreadsheets and scattered tools with one workspace for clients, projects, invoices, payments, expenses, questionnaires, support tickets, and reporting. The product follows the philosophy of its namesake, Japanese novelist Natsume Soseki: no bloat, no unnecessary complexity, just the tools you actually need to run a service business.

## 🚀 Major Advantages

### 💱 Multi-Currency Invoicing
Create invoices and record expenses in different currencies, then store exchange-rate snapshots for accurate reporting in your master currency. Automatically fetches live exchange rates so you never have to do mental math.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Data Migration
Import data from older systems, spreadsheets, PDFs, CSVs, or exported files using a built-in AI-assisted migration tool. Generate a structured JSON file with ChatGPT/Claude, and import clients, projects, invoices, and payments in one shot.

### 📝 AI-Assisted Questionnaires
Build shareable public forms for onboarding, discovery, feedback, and structured client intake. Use the drag-and-drop builder, or paste questions into ChatGPT for AI-generated forms.

### 🔓 Zero Lock-In Architecture
Self-hostable, open-source, and designed so your data stays in your own PostgreSQL database. No SaaS lock-in, no per-seat pricing surprises, and no API dependency on a third party for core features.
