# Soseki

Soseki is an open-source business operating platform for freelancers, consultants, and small agencies.

It replaces spreadsheets and scattered tools with one workspace for clients, projects, invoices, payments, expenses, questionnaires, support tickets, and reporting.

## Who It’s For

- Freelancers managing multiple clients and projects
- Small agencies billing across different currencies
- Service businesses moving away from disconnected finance and admin tools

## Major Advantages

### Multi-Currency Invoicing

Create invoices and record expenses in different currencies, then store exchange-rate snapshots for accurate reporting in a master currency.

### AI-Assisted Data Migration

Import data from older systems, spreadsheets, PDFs, CSVs, or exported files using a JSON-based migration flow.

### AI-Assisted Questionnaires

Build shareable public forms for onboarding, discovery, feedback, and structured client intake.

### Zero Lock-In Architecture

Self-hostable, open-source, and designed so your data stays in your own PostgreSQL database.
