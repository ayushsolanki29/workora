## 🌟 What is Soseki?

Say goodbye to the chaos of scattered spreadsheets, bloated SaaS subscriptions, and manual client tracking. **Soseki** is a unified, open-source business management platform that covers the entire lifecycle of your client work—from the initial handshake to the final payment.

Named after the Japanese novelist Natsume Soseki, known for his precise and uncluttered writing, our platform embodies the same philosophy: **Zero bloat, zero friction, and absolute clarity.** We give you exactly what you need to run a profitable service business without the unnecessary complexity. 

Best of all? It's **100% self-hostable and open-source**. You own your data.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- **Independent Freelancers** juggling multiple clients, projects, and deadlines.
- **Boutique Agencies** navigating international billing across diverse currencies.
- **Service Businesses** ready to break free from the limitations (and recurring costs) of tools like QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave, or Google Sheets.

## 🚀 Why Choose Soseki? (Our Core Advantages)

### 1. Multi-Currency Invoicing on Autopilot
Most invoicing tools either lock you into a single currency or force you to calculate exchange rates manually. Soseki eliminates the friction by automatically fetching live exchange rates when you log an expense or create a foreign-currency invoice. Every financial metric on your dashboard—revenue, outstanding balances, and profit—is seamlessly translated back to your master currency.

Switching platforms shouldn't mean starting from scratch. Soseki features a revolutionary AI-assisted migration engine capable of digesting PDFs, messy CSVs, QuickBooks exports, and Excel sheets. Just download our JSON template, pass your legacy data through ChatGPT or Claude, and upload the structured result to instantly import clients, projects, invoices, and payments in one flawless batch.
